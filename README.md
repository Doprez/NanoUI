NanoUI is a small, extendable and quite feature-rich UI library. It doesn't know anything **where** / **why** / **how** you use it (your OS, graphics, windowing etc). This means that you must create some wrapper classes, that act as a bridge between your application and NanoUI.

## Main features
- Independent drawing layer
- UI layer that handles user inputs, layouting, theming/styling etc
- 50+ extendable UI widgets
- Support for custom widgets
- Dynamic, extendable layouting
- Dynamic, extendable theming/styling
- SVG support
- Docking (barebones)
- No XAML

**... and NanoUI is pretty fast**.

If you are new to NanoUI, please read [Introduction](INTRODUCTION.md).
